//! Terminal-UI state.
//!
//! Everything visible on screen at idle (tabs, focus pane, sidebar
//! listing, theme, status bar, last frame layout) plus the
//! short-lived input-routing state that the editor and results
//! handlers share (pending leader keys, in-flight result bundles
//! that have not yet been promoted into a tab).
//!
//! UI state owns the *appearance* of the app. It deliberately
//! contains no data the app would survive a redraw without:
//! session, connections, history, and modal overlays live in
//! their own sub-states.
